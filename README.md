<h1>Bike Rides Analysis </h1>
The report provides in-depth analysis of a London based bike rides dataset over a span of 2 years. This will help in decision making for a bike rental company to launch and plan their rental programs based on various factors.

<h3>The following questions were answered based on this analysis: </h3>
<h5>Total number of bike rides in a selected date range</h5>
<p>Could vary based on selected range. <br>
Total: 2,025,014 <br>
Date: 01/04/2015 to 04/10/2015</p>

<h5>The impact of different weather conditions on usage of bikes</h5>
<p>Peak usage is observed during cloudy weather followed by clear weather. Whereas, the lowest usage is under rainy weather conditions.</p>
<h5>The moving average during the course of a day</h5>
<p>On average, a surge is observed around 7-8 am and 6-7pm during the weekdays and evenly spread from 11am to 6pm during weekends and holdiays. The weather conditions always lay a crucial impact on the usage.</p>
<h5>The impact of temperature and wind speed on bike usage</h5>
<p>The ideal wind speed is 10-21 kph with temperature ranging between 7.5-21 C. The moving average drops heavily at 40kph+ wind speed and 25C+ temperature. However, a drop in temperature as low as 0C doesn't have much impact on usage under normal wind conditions. </p>
<h5>The usage of bikes as per different seasons</h5>
<p>On average, summer is the most busiest season followed by fall, spring and winter respectively.
